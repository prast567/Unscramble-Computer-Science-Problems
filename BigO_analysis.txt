Complexities(Big O)

Task 0:
        Time Complexity - O(1) as the running time constant(doesnt depend on input).

Task 1:
        Time Complexity - O(n)
        Execution time is directly proportion to the input data in a linear fashion.

Task 2:
        Time Complexity - O(n)
        Execution time is directly proportion to the input data in a linear fashion.

Task 3:
        Time Complexity - O(nlog(n))
        Execution time complexity for the loops will be linear(0(n)).But, the "sorted" function has a complexity of "O(n log n)".
        So overall complexity becomes O(nlogn)

Task 4:
        Time Complexity - O(nlog(n))
        Execution time complexity for the loops will be linear(0(n)).But, the "sorted" function has a complexity of "O(nlogn)".
        So overall complexity becomes O(nlogn)
